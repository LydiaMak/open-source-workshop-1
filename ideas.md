- What if dogs are as smart as people, but don't tell us because they're too lazy to have to work?
- How loud is the average blink?
- How many rabbits would the average human be able to fight off?
- What if chairs dream? Would that make it better or worse to be a chair?
- Do animals know that sex causes babies?
- Will the creation myth AI make up for themselves say: 'And God said: `hello world!`'?
